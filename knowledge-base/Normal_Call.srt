1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,660
You have reached the essence of Oregon. This is Donna. I'll be assisting you with your inquiries today.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,820
Please be informed that this call is being recorded and monitored for quality assurance purposes. How may I help you?

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:26,880
Well, I got this essence of Oregon oil for shipping and handling costs of $5.99, a sample of it.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,900
And if I want to cancel the order, I had to do it within 15 days.

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,000
And so that is what I wanted to do.

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:48,300
I didn't want to get, you know, like a monthly for, what is it, $83 a month.

7
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,540
Okay.

8
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,320
I can't afford that.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,260
Okay. I'm more than happy. I'm happy to assist you.

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,720
So for me to be able to pull up your subscription here, could you kind of provide me your first and your last name?

11
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,880
Carolyn, C-A-R-O-L-Y-N, Lake, L-A-K-E.

12
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,680
O-L-Y-N.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,300
And then Lake.

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,560
Yes.

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,580
L-A-K-E.

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,460
Yes.

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:16,980
Okay.

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,680
I'll just go ahead to pull up your subscription here or your account.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,920
Okay.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,120
And could you kind of verify your email address, please?

21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,160
It's lake3921 at hotmail.com.

22
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,840
How about your shipping address?

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,380
310 Warren Avenue, number 2, Gillette, Wyoming, 82716.

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,420
And is your shipping address the same as your billing address?

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,480
Correct.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,960
How about your phone number?

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,960
307-680-2068.

28
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,720
Okay.

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,960
Thank you very much for that information, Ms. Lake.

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,640
If you don't want me to ask, you may know the reason why you want to cancel the subscription.

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,340
Well, I just, I thought I was just getting a sample order of it.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,560
You know, I was curious to how it worked and everything.

33
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,100
Yes.

34
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,200
I mean, have you already used it?

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,280
Not all of it, but I have.

36
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,500
Okay.

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,340
I have been using it, yes.

38
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:32,980
Okay.

39
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,020
I do understand that, Ms. Lake.

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,920
This is what I can do for you, for you to be able, you know, to maximize or enjoy the benefits of the organ.

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm going to extend your pretrial for another 15 days with no charge.

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,100
So, at least you do have 15 days to enjoy, you know, the amazing product.

43
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:03,160
And then give us a call back before the end of that 15-day additional or extension period to give us the feedback.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,380
Because what I heard from you is that you haven't used the product that much.

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,160
So, you're not, you know, you did not yet get what the benefits of it.

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:26,440
So, that's the reason why I'm extending your period or your pretrial for you to be able to enjoy and discover the benefits of Essence of Argan.

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,280
Okay?

48
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,820
Okay.

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,260
What date would that be?

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,220
Okay.

51
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,340
Let me check here.

52
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:34,420
Okay.

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,460
Okay.

54
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:34,500
Okay.

55
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:48,460
So, you're already extended your pretrial.

56
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,620
It will end on August 24th.

57
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,100
So, you need to give us a call back before August 24th to give us a feedback.

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:04,520
If you, I mean, what happened to the product, if it didn't something, you know, it gives you the benefits that you need.

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,640
But, let's say you love the product, you like the product, you don't need to give us a call back then.

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:10,960
Okay?

61
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:18,220
It will be automatically, you will be receiving another bottle for your monthly subscription.

62
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:30,500
And, on set of my call, I heard that you're not, you know, you're dealing about the price, which is $83.80, right?

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:30,800
Right.

64
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,460
Okay.

65
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:46,280
So, what I can do for you is, aside from extending your pretrial for another 15 days, I'm also giving you my employee discount, which is 20% discount.

66
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:54,160
So, instead of paying $83.80, you're going to pay only $67.04.

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,160
How about that?

68
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,120
I can't, I can't, I can't afford that.

69
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,160
Okay.

70
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,600
This is my, uh-huh, this is my maximum employee discount, a 40% employee discount, I'll give it to you.

71
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,600
It's actually a lifetime employee discount.

72
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,680
So, instead of paying $83.80, you're just repaying $50.28.

73
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,020
No, I can't, I can't, I cannot do that.

74
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,140
I can't.

75
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,020
I'd like to.

76
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:33,900
And, and, I wanted to ask you, too, is, um, how often am I supposed to use that, like, at night, or?

77
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,100
Yes, as long as you want, ma'am.

78
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,800
Just use it at night?

79
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,640
Yes, as long as you want, as long as you need it.

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,020
Oh, okay.

81
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,500
Okay, um, Ms. Lake, can I just put you in the phone for a minute?

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,480
Yeah, I can't afford.

83
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,440
Can I just put you in the phone for a minute?

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:49,660
Okay.

85
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,880
Sure.

86
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,640
Thank you.

87
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:52,700
Thank you.

88
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,640
Thank you.

89
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:39,960
Thank you very much for your patience and waiting, Ms. Lake.

90
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,760
Mm-hmm.

91
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,500
Okay.

92
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:49,340
I want to talk to, uh, my supervisor, and, um, she asked me, uh, what amount would you feel

93
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,240
the product will be more affordable for you and make your, continue your subscription with us?

94
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,880
Oh, um, well.

95
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,900
If we will ask you, do you think?

96
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,740
I, I could, I could, you know, like, $15.

97
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,080
Oh, that's.

98
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,580
I know that's, you know, but that.

99
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,560
Okay, ma'am, don't worry.

100
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,280
That's great.

101
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,620
Uh, because I've already given you my employee discount of 40%, right?

102
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,900
So my supervisor can give you another 40%, so that's an equivalent of 80%.

103
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:33,940
So instead of paying $83.80, what you'll be paying is only $16.76 every month for everybody.

104
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,880
How about that?

105
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,560
That sounds great.

106
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,980
Okay, that's great.

107
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,040
So, uh, I'm extending your, uh, pre-trial until August 24th.

108
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:52,740
So after August 24th, you will be charged only $16.76, okay?

109
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,980
So every month you will be paying, I mean, you will be receiving a bottle of essence of

110
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,760
argon and you will be, uh, enjoying the benefits of the product, but you will be only paying

111
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,200
$16.76, okay?

112
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,380
Okay.

113
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,980
Okay, then.

114
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,800
So that's great.

115
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,360
So, uh, uh, just for a recap, Ms. Lake, I extended your, uh, pre-trial for another 15

116
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,020
days and it's going to be end on August 24th.

117
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,720
So you can give us a call back, uh, by, within that period of time to give us a feedback.

118
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,660
But if, like what I've said, if you enjoy the product, it gives you the benefits, the amazing

119
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,560
benefits of the product, you don't need to give us a call back.

120
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,660
It will be automatically, you will be receiving a subscription every month, but you will be

121
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:51,920
only paying, uh, $16.76 because we already give you our employee discount of 80% for

122
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,040
lifetime, okay?

123
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,260
Okay.

124
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:55,960
All right.

125
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,920
Okay, then.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,660
So, um, is there anything else we can help you with?

127
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,080
Um, no.

128
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,240
That would be it.

129
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,340
Okay, then.

130
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,820
So, we value your business.

131
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,640
Thank you for calling Essence of Oregon.

132
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,440
Have a great day.

133
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,420
You too.

134
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,100
Bye.

135
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,160
Bye.

136
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Bye-bye.
