Sarah Sarah Thompson am I right yeah all right thank you miss Thompson I see your

14
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,380
account here yes I do see a documented service interruption in your area due to

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:30,200
a fiber line cut it looks like the estimated time for resolution is 8 p.m.

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,940
Eastern by today well I've been given three different timing I hope this time is

17
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,560
finite because I've been suffering from this for the last 48 hours and I'm

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,260
working from home and you know all my work collapsed and I have to respond to

19
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,380
people and get in touch with people meeting to attend and all these things

20
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,860
it's not like you know it's very frustrating I understand and let me just

21
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,940
check again okay here's what the field team is reporting right now they've

22
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,760
identified the specific point of failure and they've already begun splicing new

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,640
cable and based on the complexity of the repair I can see that the new and I

24
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,520
assure you firm estimate for the full restoration is within the next four

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,460
hours by 8 p.m. Eastern okay then why why the application keeps shifting the

26
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,960
timing like you know it's like a moving target kept moving from time to time it's

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,400
not like you know maybe I will hang up with you now and then again they will

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,300
change the time to different timing it is true the application has seen some

29
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,580
glitches and I understand miss Thompson once your service is fully restored we

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,400
will be happily processing an adjustment to your bill and we would happily

31
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,660
give you a $25 inconvenience credit for the trouble that you've gone through

32
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,960
would that be okay yeah that's fine as long as the internet will be back soon you

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,460
