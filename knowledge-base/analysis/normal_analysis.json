Initially, she appears hesitant and skeptical of the agent’s attempts to offer solutions. As the agent persists, offering increasingly generous discounts, the customer's frustration begins to subside, replaced by a cautious optimism and, finally, a sense of relief and agreement. There's an underlying tone of anxiety throughout, particularly concerning the pricing and the duration of the trial. The customer shows increasing engagement as the agent presents solutions, demonstrating a shift from resistance to willingness to compromise.",
    "agent_performance": "The agent’s performance is mixed. Initially, they demonstrate a professional demeanor and attempt to gather necessary information. However, the agent leans heavily on scripting and offers feel somewhat robotic and detached. The agent's attempts to empathize are weak and lack genuine warmth. While the agent successfully navigated the problem-solving aspect, the lack of personalized engagement and the excessive reliance on pre-determined solutions significantly detract from the overall customer experience. The agent repeatedly states facts without attempting to connect with the customer's specific concerns. The final solution feels driven more by the agent's desire to close the sale than by a deep understanding of the customer's financial situation. The frequent repetition of key information also felt inefficient.",

      "Minute 7:15 – The agent’s final offer of 80% discount coupled with the supervisor’s intervention highlights a critical turning point. It’s the moment the customer shows the strongest sign of agreement.",
      "Minute 8:45 – The agent’s repetition of the extended trial terms is redundant and detracts from the customer’s understanding."
    ],
    "overall_verdict": "The call achieved a satisfactory resolution, but the customer experience could have been significantly improved through greater empathy and personalization.
