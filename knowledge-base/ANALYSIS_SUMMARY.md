## 🎨 Website Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Audio Snippets (Next Step)
1. Extract 30-second representative clips from each call:
   - **Angry**: Peak frustration moment (around 1:00-1:30)
   - **Happy**: Anniversary upgrade offer (1:15-1:45)
   - **Normal**: Standard inquiry resolution (select key section)

2. Use tools like `ffmpeg` to create clips:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i Angry_Call.mp3 -ss 60 -t 30 -acodec copy Angry_Call_snippet.mp3
   ```

### Phase 2: Showcase Component
Create a React component to display:
- Audio player for 30-second snippet
- Emotion gauge (visual representation of satisfaction score)
- Agent performance meter
- Key insights from AI analysis
- Verdict badge (Handled Well: Yes/No)

### Phase 3: Visual Design
- Color coding: Red (angry), Green (happy), Blue (normal)
- Animated satisfaction meters
- Expandable transcript viewer
- Recommendation cards
- Download analysis option

### Example Component Structure
```tsx
<CallShowcase
  scenario="angry"
  audioUrl="/audio/Angry_Call_snippet.mp3"
  emotionalRanking={3}
  agentScore={6}
  handledWell={false}
  analysis={angryAnalysisData}
/>
```
